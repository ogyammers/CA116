          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p> My name is Jamie Gorman, and I am a mature student studying computer science at Dublin City University. I very much enjoy writing code, and I am currently learning python at DCU. In my spare time, I am learning C and re-writing all the tasks from my python module in C. <br>
            <br> I have a passion for learning, and the experience of being back at university is highly stimulating for me. I hope to work on some groundbreaking projects in artificial intelligence, machine learning, or blockchain when I graduate. <br>
            <br> I am a big sports fan, and I enjoy watching Manchester United, Conor McGregor, and Matthieu Van Der Pole(Cyclist). I also like to cook, and my favourite dishes are ramen, steak and sticky toffee pudding.

          <h2>Work Experience</h2>
          <p> Since 2014 I have worked for a bar and restaurant group called NolaClan and specifically in a Bar called House Dublin, One of the best venues in the city. In House, I started as a cellarman which involved the taking in of deliveries and stocking the bars with the necessary goods and perishables needed to run smoothly <br>
            <br> I then got promoted to waiting tables, where I learned a lot about drinks, food, and people, particularly social skills and people skills that have been invaluable to me so far in life. <br>
            <br> After this, I found a true passion when promoted to bartender. I enjoyed learning and mastering the technical skills required of bartending in a fast-paced, high-volume, and high standards environment. I went on to represent House in many cocktail competitions. <br>
            <br> Before returning to College this year, I served as Bar supervisor and a part of the management team. <br>
            <br>
            <br> While Bars and restaurants were closed due to covid, I worked on a building site as a general operative. This work consisted of assisting trades, tidying the site, and moving materials around. The site was One Wilton, a 150,000sqm development which is pre-let to Linkedln.
